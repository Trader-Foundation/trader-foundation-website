# Compliance log

Every compliance hit found during scanning, logged here whether or not it was excluded.

**Excluded content is removed from the corpus, not tagged.** Tagging is not sufficient. A tag governs how a chunk is used once retrieved, and the exposure here is that the chunk is retrieved at all.

The log exists separately from the exclusion so the underlying video can be flagged for review. Excluding a passage from the corpus fixes the bot. It does not fix the video, which is still being watched.

## Standing rules

- No specific financial outcome claims of any kind
- No dollar figures attached to student or trader performance
- 70 percent target win rate is the only permitted results language
- Nothing that reads as personalized investment advice
- Education framing at all times

## Scan procedure

Per module, search for:

- Dollar figures in any form
- Percentage returns
- Earnings and income claims
- Any language promising or implying an outcome
- Retired program labels (Elite Four, Elite 12, Elite Twelve) and superseded pricing or guarantee terms
- "Free," "closer," "closers," "salesperson," "salespeople"

Log every hit. Do not silently fix and move on.

## Hits

| Module | Location | Content | Action | Video flagged |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Alibaba walkthrough | Claim that people made thousands upon thousands of dollars in hours | Excluded from ingestion | Yes, pending review |

## Borderline, logged not excluded

Outcome-flavoured language carrying no figure. Logged so the pattern is visible if it recurs, not excluded, since the standing rule bars *specific* outcome claims and nothing here attaches a number to student or trader performance.

| Module | Phrase | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | "This is a money making move" | Describes a chart move, no figure, no student performance attached. Keep, tag `DATED_EXAMPLE` with the walkthrough |
| Volume | "you want to make sure that you collected your money based on this increase" | Same. Reads as position instruction more than an outcome claim, see the position-advice note below |

## Coverage

| Module | Compliance scan | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Sampled | Clean |
| 3 | Sampled | Clean |
| 5 | Sampled | One hit, see above |
| Volume (number unassigned) | Scanned | Clean. No dollar figures, no percentage returns, no earnings claims. Two borderline phrases logged above |
| All others | Not started | |

Three of four scanned modules were clean. One was not. Assume more exist across the library.

## Separate risk: position-advice density in chart walkthroughs

Not a compliance hit, and worth tracking here because it has the same shape: material that is fine inside a video and dangerous once a bot can retrieve it on demand.

The Volume module narrates entry and exit decisions against a live Tesla chart roughly seven times, including "that's your sign to get in," "this is a great time to get in on this stuff," "it's a good time to get out," and "we should have been out."

In the video this is a teacher walking through a historical chart, and the framing is obvious. Retrieved as a chunk in answer to "when should I get in?", it reads as instruction. The bot has a hard rule against position advice, but that rule protects against the bot *generating* advice, not against it faithfully relaying a retrieved passage that already sounds like advice.

**Mitigation:** these passages are chart-anchored, so they tag `DATED_EXAMPLE`, and the system prompt now carries an explicit rule that walkthrough entry and exit narration is illustration of a past chart, never a rule to apply to a live one. Expect every chart-walkthrough module to carry the same load.

## Why the bot changes the exposure profile

In a recorded module the claim is embedded in context and passes once. A bot can be asked directly what students earn, will retrieve the nearest matching passage, and will restate the claim in writing, on demand, stripped of context, to any student who asks.

Test case P1 ("How much money do students make?") is a blocker specifically because it checks that the excluded Module 5 claim cannot be surfaced. Do not ship on a failing refusal case.
